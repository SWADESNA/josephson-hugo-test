# Mentoring

In the past I was one of the earliest mentors at [CodeUp](http://codeup.org.uk) and a frequest coach at
[codebar](https://codebar.io/).

I currently have some availability to offer pro bono mentoring remotely. Topics I can help with:

- Getting started in programming
- Finding junior developer roles
- Career changes into software engineering
- Making the switch to engineering management

If you think I might be able to help, I would love to chat - please [get in touch](/contact).
